Here, I summarise the outputs from the models estimating occupancy trends for 54 British resident butterflies. 

I run the analyses on a computer cluser and must fist test whether all annual estimates have converged. 

```{r test-Rhat, }
# Source the function that loops through all model outputs and checks convergence, i.e. is Rhat >1.1?
source("./function-summarise_Rhat.R")

# Run function
summarise_Rhat("./outputs/modelOutputs")

```
